These have been categorized as VOCs but require the same epidemiological and public health response of ‘increased testing, comprehensive tracking of close contacts, prompt isolation of positive cases and contacts as well as treatment as per National Treatment Protocol’ by the states/UTs,” the government said.\r\n\r\n“From Kerala, 2,032 samples (from all 14 districts) have been sequenced.

There was the Atkins diet, the Mediterranean diet, the Ketogenic diet, the Vegan diet, the Raw food diet, the Doctor Dikshit Diet, the Intermittent Fasting diet and oh so many diets. \r\n\r\nThere are literally thousands of diet types and plans. Some people \'diet\' to lose weight, while others for gaining weight, lowering cholesterol, for detox, to live a long and healthful life, and many other reasons.\r\n\r\nA diet is a fixed plan of eating and drinking where the type and amount of food are planned out with a purpose.\r\n\r\nThe DASH diet is very popular at the moment. DASH stands for \"Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\". According to the American National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute - the NIH-supported DASH diet has topped the rankings for “heart-healthy” and “healthy eating”. And since it emphasizes eating whole foods that are naturally low in unhealthy fats and added sugars, as well as moderate portions, it may also lead to weight loss.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Harvard TH Chan School of Medicine, DASH was first introduced at a meeting of the American Heart Association in 1996 and later published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1997. \r\nThe DASH Discovery through a study:\r\n\r\nThe DASH trial randomly assigned 456 people to different diets to test the effects of dietary patterns on lowering blood pressure. The authors surmised that eating a diet with many different foods with blood-pressure-lowering nutrients would show a greater effect on blood pressure than eating single nutrients, such as found in supplements or in a limited diet. \r\nThree diets were tested: \r\n\r\n    A control diet, or a standard American diet, \r\n    A fruits and vegetable diet, similar to the control diet but providing more fruits and vegetables and fewer snacks and sweets, and \r\n    A combination diet rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and low-fat dairy foods with reduced amounts of saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol. \r\n\r\nThe last two diets were richer in nutrients associated with lower blood pressure, such as potassium, magnesium, calcium, fiber, and protein. All three diets provided about 3000 mg sodium, which is more than the recommended amount from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans but less than the average sodium intake for Americans.\r\n\r\nDespite no weight changes, the combination diet reduced hypertension more than the other two diets. Those with hypertension showed greater decreases in blood pressure than those without hypertension. The reduction of blood pressure in the DASH combination diet was comparable to that of people on medication for stage 1 hypertension.\r\n\r\nThe results of this landmark study contributed much of the scientific basis for the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 and later editions. This diet is now widely acclaimed as a flexible and balanced eating plan that helps create a heart-healthy eating style for life.', '2021-03-25', 0, 1),

The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle-C51 (PSLV-C51) blasted off from the first launch pad at 10.24 a.m. laden with 19 satellites including Amazonia-1.\r\n\r\nAt 10.24 a.m. the 44.4 metre tall PSLV-C51 rocket blasted off from the first launch pad here laden with 19 satellites-foreign and Indian- and slowly rose-up towards the skies with thick orange flame at its tail.\r\n\r\nThe rocket slowly gained speed as it went up while emitting a rolling thunder sound. Seventeen minutes into its flight the rocket slung its primary passenger the Brazilian satellite Amazonia-1 - the first of the 19 satellites- into its intended Sun Synchronous Orbit.\r\n\r\nAmazonia-1 is the optical earth observation satellite of National Institute for Space Research (INPE). This satellite would further strengthen the existing structure by providing remote sensing data to users for monitoring deforestation in the Amazon region and analysis of diversified agriculture across the Brazilian territory, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said.\r\n\r\nWith this India has slung 329 foreign satellites till date. If all goes well, then India will end the mission orbiting a total of 342 foreign satellites, all for a fee.\r\n\r\nIndia\'s first space mission for 2021 is one of the longest for a PSLV rocket is expected to conclude 1 hour, 55 minutes and 7 seconds into its flight. The rocketing is a fully commercial one of NewSpace India Ltd (NSIL).\r\n\r\nThe 18 co-passenger satellites include four from IN-SPACe (three UNITYsats from consortium of three Indian academic institutes (Jeppiaar Institute of Technology, Sriperumbudur, G.H.Raisoni College of Engineering, Nagpur and Sri Shakthi Institute of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore), one Satish Dhawan Sat from Space Kidz India) with an engraved picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as Bhagavad Gita in a flash.\r\n\r\nThe remaining 14 satellites are Sindhu Netra, an Indian technology demonstration satellite from Defence Research Development Organisation\'s (DRDO) research centre Imarat, Hyderabad to identify suspicious ships and 13 satellites from the USA viz., SAI-1 NanoConnect-2, a technology demonstration satellite and 12 SpaceBees satellites for two-way satellite communications and data relay.\r\n\r\nFor the third time ISRO is using the PSLV rocket\'s DL variant that will have two strap-on booster motors.\r\n\r\nIn normal configuration the PSLV is a four stage/engine expendable rocket powered by solid and liquid fuels alternatively. Six booster motors will also be strapped on to the first stage to give higher thrust during the initial flight moments.\r\n\r\nBut the PSLV rocket that flew on Sunday was the DL variant having only two strap-booster motors. This rocket variant was used the first time to put the Microsat R satellite into orbit on January 24, 2019. The Indian space agency has PSLV variants with two and four strap-on motors, larger PSLV-XL and the Core Alone variant without any strap-on motors. The choice of the rocket to be used for a mission depends on the weight of the satellite and the orbit where the satellite has to be orbited. Be that as it may, the PSLV-C51 mission is one of longest ones.\r\n\r\nAs per its flight plan, the rocket will put the 19 satellites into Sun Synchronous Orbit over a duration of 1 hour, 55 minutes and 7 seconds. During its flight, the rocket\'s fourth stage engine will be cut off and restarted a couple of times, the first one will be at 16 minutes into its flight. Just over one hour into its flight the rocket\'s engine will be restarted for about nine seconds before it is shut down again.\r\n\r\nAfter 1 hour, 49 minutes and 52 seconds the rocket\'s engine will be reignited for eight seconds after which the 18 piggy back satellites will be put into orbit.', '2021-03-25', 0, 1),

Now, after three months of rollout, Twitter has a response to the prompt and according to the firm, it has significantly contributed to the rate of retweets. The official Communications team of the micro-blogging site shared a tweet on Friday, saying, “We shouldn\'t have to say this, but you should read an article before you Tweet it”. In a series of tweets, the team said how people were opening articles 40 per cent more often now after the prompts have been introduced. Twitter users were opening articles before ‘RT’ing first. This has increased by 33 per cent. They said that some people ended up not sharing the tweet also after opening the article. Twitter did not stop by sharing the success rate of the feature. Now, the social media platform is also rolling out an enhanced version of the prompt to a wider range of users. Earlier, the feature was rolled out to mostly Android Twitter users. But now, it seems users globally are going to see this prompt before sharing any link. Moreover, this feature is becoming more compact now, so as to not inconvenience users. It will become smaller after users have seen it once. It can be expected that users share certain articles only after knowing all the facts on the topic or based upon what is written in a certain article.
